The collection of my solutions to the problems posted at Project Euler.

  http://projecteuler.net/

If you are interested in working on the problems yourself, you should visit
the site and try it on your own before looking at my solutions.

Solutions are typically run with:  time ruby 1.rb
but that hasn't stopped me from doing some of the one-liner solutions
directly in irb and pasting in the result.

Note: Some of these solutions may not be the most efficient. Brute force works
if you have enough time. (And sometimes you recognize that the partial
solution found during the brute-force attempt lets you derive the solution
even if you don't go back and rewrite the program to arrive at the solution
the "right" way.)

You can take a short-cut to my Project Euler profile through

Good Luck!
