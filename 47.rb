# 04 July 2003
#
# The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
#
# 14 = 2 x 7
# 15 = 3 x 5
#
# The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors
# are:
#
# 644 = 2Â² x  7 x 23
# 645 = 3  x  5 x 43
# 646 = 2  x 17 x 19.
#
# Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes
# factors. What is the first of these numbers?
